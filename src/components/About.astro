          <p>
            I've spent nearly a decade building for the web — from award-winning
            agencies working on projects for Microsoft and Sony, to the Shopify
            ecosystem where I've found my home. But what changed everything was
            building my own ecommerce brand on Shopify and scaling it from zero
            to six figures.
          </p>

          <p>
            That experience rewired how I think about development. When I look at
            your store, I'm not just thinking about clean code — I'm thinking
            about what's going to move your conversion rate, increase your AOV,
            and keep customers coming back. I've been on your side of the P&L. I
            know what it costs when something is built wrong, and what it's worth
            when it's built right.
          </p>

          <p>
            I write the code for your store, alongside a senior Shopify developer
            who collaborates with me on select projects. No overseas outsourcing,
            no white-label dev shops — just experienced, US-based developers who
            care about getting it right.
          </p>

            I work best asynchronously and have been called a "secret PM" by
            clients for how I organize and run projects. Every engagement runs
            through Basecamp with clear timelines, regular updates, and zero
            chasing.

            <strong class="text-gray-600 font-medium">A note on availability:</strong> I operate during regular business hours (Mon–Fri, 9am–6pm PT) and pride myself on fast, proactive communication — but I'm not a 24/7 agency. If your business needs round-the-clock support or weekend coverage, we're probably not the right fit. If you want a responsive, organized partner who treats your project like it matters, let's talk.
